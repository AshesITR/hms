# hms

A simple class for storing time-of-day values

The values are stored as a numeric vector that contains the number of seconds
since midnight.  Supports construction from time values, coercion to and from
various data types, and formatting.  Can be used in a data frame.

Compared to `POSIXct`, no date is stored, although the values can exceed
the 24-hour boundary.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

```{r}
library(hms)
hms(56, 34, 12)
as.hms(1)
as.hms("12:34:56")
as.hms(Sys.time())
as.POSIXct(hms(1))

d <- data.frame(hours = 1:3)
d$hms <- hms(hours = d$hours)
d
```

Install the package from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krlmlr/hms")
```
